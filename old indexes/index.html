        <h1>Cherry Yang</h1>

          <p>I'm passionate about delivering impactful results with incredible people. Having worked in offices with 5 people to corporations with 125,000, the most valuable things a company has is its culture, people, and ideas. My curiosity for all functions in business drives me to continue learning, improving, and seeking new experiences. I have been a Community Manager at <a href="http://www.hubba.com/">Hubba (AKA Canada's next unicorn) </a>for 7 months.</p>

        <h1>Experience</h1>

          <h2>Community Manager @ Hubba (7 Months)</h2>

            <p>Being the first 40 at Hubba, a fast-growing start-up, I get to wear many hats at work. In the 7 months at Hubba, my role has changed almost entirely. My first month consisted of welcoming brands on to the platform via phone calls, customer support, and sending product marketing email campaigns. Currently, I execute user engagement campaigns, build relationships with free users, manage paid accounts, and launch new product features. The most rewarding aspect of my work is testing and revising my own ideas and seeing the them mature to be built into the product.</p>

          <h2>Analyst @ Hugessen Consulting (8 Months)</h2>

            <p>Hugessen Consulting advises public companies on how to pay their C-suite. The various projects taught me how to think strategically on structuring executive pay to incentivize long-term decision making and performance. I used Excel and PowerPoint on a daily basis to analyze data and communicate my findings towards the Board of Directors and C-suite.</p>

              <li>Skiing: multicolored bruise consisted of purble, green, brown and blue hues</li>

          <h2>Social Causes</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Emergency Aid - I was lucky enough to go on a trip to the Philippines on a house building trip. While visiting the slums, I was shocked by the living conditions of those displaced by typhoons. My dream is to start a technologically advanced emergency aid company to help people on the worst day of their lives.</li>
              <li>Education - In third year, I traveled to Kenya with two classmates to teach a month-long course in business to second year students at Moi University. Teaching was a life changing experience because I learned about Kenyan culture, society, and people. Immersing myself in the university community in Kenya taught me empathy, gratitude, and professionalism.</li>
              <li>Healthcare - For 3 years in university, I dedicated much of my time in and outside of class to CAISA Fashion Show. The student-run fashion show was the largest in Canada and supported the Children's Health Foundation. My CAISA Fashion Show journey solidified belief in universal access to basic healthcare</li>
